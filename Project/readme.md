## 📂 Featured Project: 3D E-Commerce Platform on AWS  

**Goal:**  
Build a global e-commerce platform where users can interact with **3D product models** in real time.  

**Highlights:**  
- 🌐 **Global Delivery** with Route 53 + CloudFront  
- 💾 **Data Layer** combining DynamoDB & Aurora Global DB  
- ⚡ **Performance Boosts** with ElastiCache & optimized 3D assets  
- 🔐 **Enterprise Security** via Cognito, WAF, Shield, and KMS  
- 📊 **Observability** with CloudWatch, X-Ray, and CloudTrail  
- 💸 **Cost Optimization** using Spot, Glacier, and intelligent tiering
